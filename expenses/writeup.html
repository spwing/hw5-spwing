	<title>Differences between spreadsheet-like app and newer app</title>
</head>
<body>
	<ol>
		<li>There is now two seperate sections, one for adding expenses and one for 
			viewing expenses. I am aligning content that is similar near eachother
		</li>
		<li>
			There are now radio and checkbox options to make the app more efficient to 
			fill out (in a click) and safer, since you can't accidentally fill in the 
			wrong section of the spreadsheet.
		</li>
		<li>
			You can now view the expenses in categories the which helps with efficiency
			if you need to find an expense.
		</li>
		<li>
			For efficiency you can delete an expense in one click rather than having to 
			eliminate and blank out a row
		</li>
		<li>
			For safety dates have been added so that you can know when the expense
			occurred. This allows for mistakes to be caught easier and easier browsing
			of the expenses. 
		</li>
		<li>
			For efficiency and safety at the top of the app I show who owes money so that it is 
			very clear the result of all of the expenses.
		</li>
