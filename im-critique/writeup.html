		<p> I picked facebook messenger, iMessage, and Whatsapp
			because they are all designed for daily text with contacts, 
			usually friends that are in your phone or in the case of 
			facebook, on your messenger. For the sake of this critique I am
			using the UIs on my phone only. 
		</p>
		<li>
			<h1> Facebook Messenger</h1>
			<h2> Efficiency</h2>
			<p> All the tools do a great job having a flexible 
				search, meaning I can search by name, phone number,
				group name, or words in a conversation making it very 
				efficient to find contacts and historical information I 
				want to jump to.
			</p>
			<h2> Safety</h2>
			<p> Facebook messenger has a message request section. Therefore 
				you can only receive messages from people that have accepted 
				your friend request or message request. This means all the 
				texts you are receiving are guaranteed to be approved by you 
				and not spam like in imessage.
			</p>
			<p> Messenger shows you when someone has last engaged with your 
				message chat as well as whether or not their online where iMessage 
				just chooses to show whether or not a message is read. Showing 
				system status is good, but messenger can innacurately represent status. 
				As long as you are on facebook or it is up on your screen (I keep many tabs
				open) it shows that you are online, when I am not engaging with facebook 
				at the moment.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h1> Whatsapp</h1>
			<h2> Learnability</h2>
			<p> All of the applications follow standards such as when I 
				press and hold a message I can react to it. This helps
				me to seemlessly send messages using standards I knew from 
				a previous application.
			</p>
			<h2> Efficiency</h2>
			<p> Whatsapp doesn't allow you to message someone that is not 
				in your contacts. You must add them first and then message
				them. This violates user flexibility and freedom because 
				then I have to add contacts that I might only message once
				and would rather not have clutter my contact list.
			</p>
			<p> When trying to send a new message whatsapp is the 
				only application that displays first the ability to 
				add a new contact, new group, new community which takes a 
				significant portion of my screen. Likely when I am 
				texting someone I will already have them in my contacts, so 
				I would not prioritize this much screen space to an 
				anticipation that is not accurate. 
			</p>
			<h2> Safety</h2>
			<p> On whatsapp you can delete a message that you accidentally 
				section maybe to the wrong person or group. There is also this idea
				of a group admin that can globally delete innapropriate messages
				that is a good feature for managing large groups and gives admin 
				control and flexibility over their group.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h1> iMessage</h1>
			<h2> Efficiency</h2>
			<p> My messages are sorted by most recent item sent and 
				recieved on all the applications which anticipates and 
				allows me to quickly jump into a more recent conversation 
				that I am more likely to reply to
			</p>
			<h2> Safety</h2>
			<p> iMessage uses a phone number and as long as someone
				has your phone number they can message you. So it is 
				possible to get spam because someone can generate your 
				phone number and just message it. I am assuming there are 
				spam filters apple uses, but there is no "spam folder" like 
				the messenger "message request" folder. You must block 
				a spam number, so you save in efficiency messaging a new contact, but 
				you lose in error prevention because now the user has to manually
				block someone every time this happens.
