	<h1> Evaluation of Expense App #6</h1>
	<h2> Disclaimer!! I couldn't get the functionality
		of adding expenses to appear on the expense chart. In some of my 
		comments here I am assuming the functionality that the designer 
		was going for - that you enter a payment and it shows up on the 
		view payment details screen. If you refresh without saving than your 
		payment doesn't automatically save.

			<h3>Problem: User might go back without saving data</h3>
			<h3>Heuristic</h3>
			<p> Error prevention</p>
			<h3>Description</h3>
			<p>
				Because the display of the payment details is on another reloaded 
				screen, everytime you leave that screen if data isn't saved by 
				pressing the save button, it is lost. There is no back arrow on the 
				screen, so you have to use the web browser back arrow which reloads 
				the page.
			</p>
			<h3>Severity: Severe</h3>
			<h3>Recommendation</h3>
			<p>
				Rather than a save button, I would automatically save a payment after 
				they hit enter. 
				If you combine this with the ability to delete a payment, this will 
				give the user more autonomy while ensuring that it is harder to make 
				mistakes with forgetting to save (error prevention). Finally, for 
				efficiency of use I would recommend keeping everything on one page 
				so that the user doesnt keep having to toggle between pages

			<h3>Problem: User doesn't can't see that their expense was added</h3>
			<h3>Heuristic</h3>
			<p>Visibility of System Status</p>
			<h3>Description</h3>
			<p> 
				When a user enters a payment, only the form inputs clear, but 
				nothing else happens so it is not visible to the user that 
				the expense was added. The expense list is on a different page, so 
				if the user wanted to confirm that the expense was added they would 
				have to toggle to that page to check.
			</p>
			<h3>Severity: Severe</h3>
			<h3>Recommendation</h3>
			<p>
				I would display the expenses in the same screen and have the added 
				expense row get briefly highlighted or faded out and back when it gets 
				added to the chart so that the color change draws the eye to notice something 
				happened.

			<h3>Problem: User could produce an error notification</h3>
			<h3>Heuristic </h3>
			<p>
				Error Reporting, Diagnosis, and Recovery 
			</p>
			<h3>Description</h3>
			<p>
				When I try and choose the same person to add two different expense 
				amounts I get an error notification that I have to close out manually. It
				describes what I can't do, but not how to fix it and its hard to know 
				where on the page the error is coming from. 
			</p>
			<h3>Severity: Major</h3>
			<h3>Recommendation</h3>
			<p>
				I would leave open two expense amount columns and have one set for Neo
				and one set for Trinity. Start them both at zero so that the user 
				doesn't need to change one if they don't have to. Further you don't have 
				to click the drop down so it is faster to get to both sections and there 
				is no confusion in what amount 1 and amount 2 means.

			<h3>Problem: All the buttons and interactive components 
				are small and can't be controlled by keys
			</h3>
			<h3>Heuristic</h3>
			<p>Flexibility and Efficiency</p>
			<h3>Description</h3>
			<p>
				All of the buttons are small and smushed together in one corner making it 
				hard for someone to quickly interact with the tool. 
			</p>
			<h3>Severity: Major</h3>
			<h3>Recommendation</h3>
			<p> I would make the buttons a lot bigger and sections for typing a lot bigger 
				as well. It would also be nice to be able to use keyboard shortcuts, such as 
				enter to assist you in getting to the next element quickly. Finally you 
				could autofill the date to todays date to give the user a shortcut to 
				something that they might select more often.
